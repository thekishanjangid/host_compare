      <h2>The Importance of a Good Domain Name</h2>
      <p>Your domain name is more than just a web address; it's your online brand. A good domain name can increase brand awareness, improve search engine rankings, and make it easier for customers to find you.</p>
      
      <h2>Key Principles for Choosing a Domain</h2>
      <h3>1. Keep it Short and Simple</h3>
      <p>Short names are easier to remember and type. Aim for 6-14 characters if possible.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Use Keywords Strategically</h3>
      <p>If you're a local bakery, having "bakery" or your city name in the domain can help with SEO. But don't stuff keywords; keep it natural.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Avoid Hyphens and Numbers</h3>
      <p>Hyphens can be confusing (is it dash or hyphen?) and numbers (5 vs five) can lead to typos. Stick to letters.</p>
      
      <h3>4. Stick with .com (Usually)</h3>
      <p>While there are many new extensions, .com is still the most trusted and memorable. If your .com is taken, .net or .org are solid alternatives.</p>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Take your time. Once you register a domain, it's yours for a year. Make sure it's the one you want to build your brand on.</p>

    title: 'Domain Registrar vs Web Hosting – Complete Beginner Guide',
    excerpt: 'Confused about the difference between a domain and hosting? We explain how they work together to get your website online.',
    content: `
      <h2>The Analogy: House and Address</h2>
      <p>Think of your website like a house. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Domain Name (Registrar):</strong> This is your street address (e.g., 123 Main St). It tells people where to find you.</li>
        <li><strong>Web Hosting:</strong> This is the land and the house itself where your furniture (content) lives.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Do You Need Both?</h2>
      <p>Yes. You can retain a domain without hosting, but you can't have a live website without hosting. To get a website online, you need to point your domain name to your hosting provider's server.</p>
      
      <h2>Should You Buy Them Together?</h2>
      <p>Many hosting companies (like Bluehost or Hostinger) offer a free domain for the first year. This is convenient for beginners. However, keeping them separate (e.g., Domain at Namecheap, Hosting at SiteGround) can offer better security and easier transferability later.</p>

    excerpt: 'From classic .com to niche .tech, we explore the pros and cons of different domain extensions and which one is right for you.',
    content: `
      <h2>The Classics</h2>
      <h3>.com</h3>
      <p>The gold standard. 50%+ of all websites use it. Most trusted, easiest to remember.</p>
      
      <h3>.org</h3>
      <p>Originally for non-profits, now open to all. Trusted and professional.</p>
      
      <h3>.net</h3>
      <p>Often the second choice if .com is taken. Good for tech companies.</p>
      
      <h2>New TLDs (Top Level Domains)</h2>
      <p>Extensions like .io, .co, .tech, and .store are growing in popularity.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>.io:</strong> Huge in the tech and startup world.</li>
        <li><strong>.store:</strong> Perfect for e-commerce.</li>
        <li><strong>.blog:</strong> clear intent for content creators.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Does Extension Affect SEO?</h2>
      <p>Google says no. A .pizza domain can rank just as well as a .com. However, user trust and click-through rates (CTR) are often higher for .com.</p>

    content: `
      <h2>The "First Year" Discount Trap</h2>
      <p>Registrars often sell domains for $0.99 or even $0.01 for the first year. This is a loss leader strategy.</p>
      
      <h2>Renewal Prices</h2>
      <p>When your domain renews after year 1, you will pay the "regular" price. For a .com, this is usually between $10 and $15. For fancy new TLDs like .io, it can be $60+.</p>
      
      <h2>Hidden Fees to Watch For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ICANN Fee:</strong> A mandatory $0.18 fee per year.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> Some registrars charge $10+ for this; many (like Namecheap and Google) value it free.</li>
        <li><strong>Redemption Fees:</strong> If you let your domain expire, getting it back can cost $80-$200.</li>

    excerpt: 'Moving your domain to a new provider is easier than you think. Follow this step-by-step checklist to do it safely.',
    content: `
      <h2>Why Transfer?</h2>
      <p>Maybe your current registrar has terrible support, or their renewal prices just hiked up. Transferring lets you move to a better service.</p>
      
      <h2>The Checklist</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Unlock your domain:</strong> Log into your current registrar and turn off "Domain Lock".</li>
        <li><strong>Get the Auth Code:</strong> Request an EPP/Auth code from your current registrar.</li>
        <li><strong>Initiate Transfer:</strong> Go to the new registrar (e.g. Namecheap) and select "Transfer". Enter your domain and code.</li>
        <li><strong>Approve the Transfer:</strong> You will get an email to confirm. Click the link.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Crucial rules</h2>
      <p>You cannot transfer a domain within 60 days of registering it or transferring it previously. This is an ICANN rule.</p>

      <p>Web hosting is paying rent for space on a computer (server) that is always connected to the internet.</p>
      
      <h2>What Are You Paying For?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> How many files/images you can have.</li>
        <li><strong>Bandwidth:</strong> How many visitors can come to your site at once.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Ensuring the power never goes out (Uptime).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Do I Need a "Server"?</h2>
      <p>Yes, but you don't need a physical one in your house. Hosting companies have massive warehouses (data centers) full of them, and you just rent a tiny slice.</p>

      <h2>Cloud Hosting</h2>
      <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Airbnb network. If one house breaks, you instantly move to another one. It's infinite and redundant.</p>

      <h2>How Hosting Helps</h2>
